        <p>I have always loved design and programming and I find it interesting
          when you combine them.
        </p>
        <p>Before I started my studies at JTH, I took one semester at Blekinge
          Tekniska Högskola (BTH), to study Web programming online. I quickly
          realized that not being on campus was demotivating and made it
          difficult for me to learn. This lead to me ending my studies at BTH
          and continued the semester working.</p>
        <p>After keeping an eye out on other programs and schools I came across
          Jönköping Universtiy and was imidiatly drawn to its viraity of
          programs and courses. There I found a program that combined my two
          passions, which lead me to start studying New Media Design.</p>
